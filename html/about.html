                <h3>Hello,</h3>
                <p>My name is Brian Tran, I'm an international student from Vietname.</p>
                <p>I've been in Canada for almost 3 years and I'm studying in Douglas College as a Computer Science Student. I spent my first year taking ELLA courses to improve my English. After that, I took some general courses before decided to take part in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>After ELLA, I took C# and Java, which sparked my interest in Computer Science. Right now, I am taking Multimedia Web Development Course. I'll put down a link in the <b>"References"</b> to show you what this course is about.</p>
